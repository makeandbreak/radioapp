Ths is a partially hard coded hobby hack so it may only be of 
interest for 'code borrowers' and may not be so useful as 
a complete application.

Simple nodejs web application that lists pre-configured streaming
radio stations and makes them selectable

To run this you need to understan how to set up nodejas and 
the 'require' packages. This code runs on any Linux install
that supports nodejs (version not critical) and has 
'Music Player Deamon' with it's command line client package
installed.

To use https uncomment 'for ssl:' code in index.js. You will 
need to generate a server certificate and register it with a 
CA to make this truly a usable option. I have also noted that 
most 'Mobile/Pad' browsers do not permit usage of certificates
not registered with a CA (at minimum they block the loading of 
page scripts). Also older nodejs versions can not be used as 
they do not implement the 'cipher' configuration now inforced
by latest releases of Chrome etc  

To run:

   node index.js   

To access running server

   http://<server ip>:8081/

To update station list edit

   stations.json
