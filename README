Ths is a partially hard coded hobby hack so it may only be of 
interest for 'code borrowers' and may not be so useful as 
a complete application.

Simple nodejs web application that lists pre-configured streaming
radio stations and makes them selectable

To run this you need to understan how to set up nodejas and 
the 'require' packages. This code runs on any Linux install
that supports nodejs (version not critical) and has 
'Music Player Deamon' with it's command line client package
installed.

To run:

   node index.js   

To access running server

   http://<server ip>:8081/

To update station list edit

   stations.json
